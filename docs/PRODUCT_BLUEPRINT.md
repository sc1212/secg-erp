# PRODUCT BLUEPRINT — Construction ERP (Enterprise Grade)

## Vision
A single operating system for construction companies covering precon to closeout with full financial traceability.

## Product pillars
1. **Financial command** — real-time cash, budget, margin, retainage, and forecast clarity.
2. **Execution control** — project workflows tied to approvals and commitments.
3. **Operational unification first, commercialization second** — single internal OS now; multi-tenant packaging later.

## Feature set (enhanced)
### Executive command center
- KPI ribbon (cash position, backlog, WIP, gross margin, overage risk, AR aging).
- Drill-through from each KPI to transaction-level evidence.
- Org/division/project filters with saved executive views.

### Job costing and controls
- Cost code hierarchy with variance root-cause tagging.
- Budget baselines + revisions with reason codes.
- Forecast-at-completion model and confidence scoring.

### Change order intelligence
- CO lifecycle with threshold-based approvals.
- Budget impact simulation before approval.
- Client-facing and internal CO separation.

### AP + vendor risk
- Invoice capture, coding, approval routing, waiver checkpoints.
- Vendor scorecards: schedule reliability, quality defects, compliance, response time.
- Insurance/license expiry alerts.

### AR / draws / retainage
- AIA-compatible draw package generation.
- SOV line controls and % complete consistency checks.
- Retainage ledger with release milestones.

### CRM to operations handoff
- Lead/proposal pipeline with conversion metrics.
- Win/loss reasons feeding estimator performance insights.
- Sold project auto-seeding into project setup templates.

### Document intelligence
- Versioned documents with immutable audit timeline.
- Scope-aware permissions and secure sharing links.
- Required document checklists by workflow stage.

### Field usability
- Mobile-first daily logs, progress photos, punch updates.
- Offline-safe draft capture for weak connectivity zones.
- Role-sensitive data visibility (financial redaction for field users where configured).

## “Insane mode” differentiators (high-value add-ons)
1. **Predictive overrun engine**
   - Flags likely cost overruns early using trend + commitment burn rates.
2. **Cash crunch radar**
   - Projects 13-week cash strain scenarios with configurable assumptions.
3. **Approval SLA monitor**
   - Measures approval cycle bottlenecks by role/team.
4. **Estimator-to-actual feedback loop**
   - Compares estimate assumptions vs actual outcomes by cost code/vendor.
5. **Executive anomaly feed**
   - Detects unusual payment patterns, sudden variance spikes, or stale commitments.

## Multi-tenant commercialization model
- Tenant-level configuration for roles, approval thresholds, billing mode defaults, and divisions.
- Tiered plan packaging:
  - Core Finance
  - Finance + Ops
  - Enterprise (integrations + advanced analytics).
